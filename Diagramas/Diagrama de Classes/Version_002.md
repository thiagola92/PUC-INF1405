# Changes #

## Hand Class ##
Hand Class **Deleted**

Reason: For now, there is no reason to have one class responsabile for one single Array of **Card**, i am creating this Array on **Player** class.

## Player Class ##
As said in **Hand** Class, received one Array of **Card**

## Board Class ##
Created two methods
* buy_from_deck(Player): void
* buy_from_discard(Player): void
