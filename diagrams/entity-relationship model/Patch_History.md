# Version 002 #
"Vida", "Habilidade", "Azul", "Amarelo", "Vermelho", "Arma", "Equipamento", "Efeito" are attributes not objects.  
"Jogador" interact with "Carta" and "Carta" can be on "Mão"/"Deck"/"Descarte" instead of you interacting you one of them and they interacting with "Carta".  

# Version 003 #
"Time" and "Função" are not objects, they were just holding attributes from objects before then, i am removing them and letting hte attributes.  

# Version 004 #
I am removing "Personagem" from the game, if i think the game is boring i will add back.  

# Version 005 #
Everything changed to english.  
Removed "Habilidade" from "Player" because it was one attribute unique from "Personagem".
