## Hand ##
Class Hand **Deleted**

Reason: For now, there is no reason to have one class responsabile for one single Array of **Card**, i am creating this Array on class **Player**.

## Player ##
As said in class **Hand** , received one Array of **Card**

## Board ##
Created two methods
* buy_from_deck(Player): void
* buy_from_discard(Player): void
